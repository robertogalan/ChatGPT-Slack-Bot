# Slack bot with OpenAI's GPT-3

#### A simple python script to connect ChatGPT with Slack

##### This is a very simple python script written by OpenAI Chatgpt 3.5 turbo that connects its API with Slack. It listens for messages in channels and direct messages and responds with text generated by OpenAI's GPT-3.

The most difficult part is fighting Slack's app configuration, create a new app and set up a "Bot token" and "App token", also grab an API Key from openai, log into your openai account, click on your profile picture/view api.

## Prerequisites
Before you can use this bot, you will need:

- A Slack account
- A Slack bot token
- A Slack app token
- An OpenAI API key
- A cloud instance, linux host, old pc/mac or raspberry pi running Python 3.X -- How to set that up is beyond the scope of this readme, sorry. (tip: ask ChatGPT!)

## Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/example/slack-bot-with-openai-gpt3.git
```

Install the required Python packages.

```
pip install openai
pip install slack_bolt
pip install slack_sdk
pip install slack
```

Edit the top of bot.py with the following structure with your api info: 
``````
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN = "xoxb-0000000000000000000000000000"
SLACK_APP_TOKEN = "xapp-0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
OPENAI_API_KEY  = "sk-000000000000000000000000000"
```
Replace the slack_bot_token, slack_app_token, and openai_api_key values with your own tokens and key.

Run the bot.

```
python3 bot.py
```

### Usage
Once the bot is running, it will listen for messages in channels and direct messages. When it receives a message, it will generate a response using OpenAI's GPT-3 and post the response in the same channel or direct message.

## Now the fun part...
At your Slack api settings, look for a "Manifest" section and import the manifest.json file, that will take care of the tedious Slack bot configuration.
